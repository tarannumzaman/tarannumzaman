1. Will be joining the Information Systems department at UMBC starting Spring 2025.
2. Received my first-ever NSF grant: NSF CRII 2024!
3. Best Paper Award in IEEE CCWC 2024.

I am looking for self-motivated and hard-working Ph.D. students in Software Engineering, with experience in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Data Mining, and Program Analysis.

About Me
======

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Computer and Information Science at the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute (SUNY Poly). I have earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Kentucky in 2022. My advisor is Dr. Tingting Yu. I have earned my MS and BSc. degree in Computer Science from the University of Dhaka in 2013 and 2011 respectively.


Research Interest
======
I am interested in techniques that make computer systems more autonomous, efficient, reliable, and user-friendly. In my current research works, I used Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Discovery, Information Retrieval, and Program Analysis to make the concurrent software systems autonomous.
