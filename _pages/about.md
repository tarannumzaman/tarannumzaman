1. One paper aceepted in FiCloud 2023.
2. One Paper published in IEEE SoutheastCon2023.

I am searching for self motivated and hard working MS students in the Software Engineering, Data Mining, and Information Systems.

About Me
======

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Computer and Information Science at the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute (SUNY Poly). I have earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Kentucky in 2022. My advisor is Dr. Tingting Yu. I have earned my MS and BSc. degree in Computer Science from the University of Dhaka in 2013 and 2011 respectively.


Research Interest
======
I am interested in techniques that make computer systems more autonomous, efficient, reliable, and user-friendly. In my current research works, I used Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Discovery, Information Retrieval, and Program Analysis to make the concurrent software systems autonomous.
